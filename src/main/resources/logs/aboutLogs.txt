A note about logs:

Logs are named with a timestamp in the format yyyyMMddhhmmss.txt according to when the server is launched (for servers) or when you login to a server (for clients).

Logs containing private message text begin with uv_ while logs that have been sanitized begin with red_

Logging of games is enabled by defualt. If you wish to change that defualt setting, you can do so by editing the relevant line in the jpConfig.ini file.

HTML logging of games is also enabled by default. If you wish to generate plain-text only logs, set bHtmlLogs=false in jpConfig.ini
