GM-0

Everything after the first line is just thrown away.

Please note that the name you wish to go by must be followed by -0 in order to meet the minimum requirements for a player's name in the JParanoia engine. Don't worry, it won't appear anywhere in the game, players will only see everything before the last two characters.
