# playerList.txt
#
# This is the JParanoia player list file
#
# The only practical limit to the number of player characters in the game
# is the resolution of your monitor. If your game will include more or less
# than 6 players, just add or delete lines in the PCs section as appropriate.
#
# Keep in mind that if you run more than 6 players, you will need to resize
# your window to view all of the private message panes.
#
# Player data should be in the following format for the GM and PCs:
#
# Name (for reference) | is PC / NPC (p/n) | password | name of player's file


# GM
#
# Note that the GM MUST be the first entry in this file.

# PCs (Player Characters)
#
# The "names" (the first entry in each line) are not important
# and are only there to help you keep track of who has which password.
# The player's names and clone numbers are parsed from the first line
# of the character sheet files.

# NPCs (Non-Player Characters)
#
# Please note that The Computer *MUST* be the first NPC listed here
# in order for the special font size increase to be associated
# with it.
# 
# The reason you want to list your NPCs here is so you can spoof them
# during the game. So instead of:
#
# GM: A random clone walks up to you.
#
# You can do:
#
# * A random clone walks up to you. *
#
#
# IMPORTANT: Since NPCs don't have character sheet files, whatever you
# put for the name HERE is exactly how their names will appear in-game.

# Spare NPCs
#
# Any character name starting with "spareNPC" will be loaded as a spare NPC.
# All this means is that an entry will appear in the Spare NPCs menu, allowing
# you to rename a spare NPC in the event that you need an NPC you did not
# anticipate.
#
# You can have as few or as many spares as you need, however bear in mind
# spare NPCs will appear in your spoof list just like the normal NPCs, so in
# order to avoid clutter you will not want a needlessly large list of spares.
#
# These entries do NOT need to be at the end of this file.
