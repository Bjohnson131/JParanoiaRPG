# JParanoiaRPG
Decompiled source code for the now defunct JParanoia(1.31.1). I personally used JD-GUI. Unsure if missing sources.
All credit goes to the JParanoia team for the creation of this software, and I will take down this repository when requested.
The goal is to fix issues with this program as the site is no longer operational.

I DO NOT OWN THIS SOURCE CODE, UPLOADING IT IN HOPES OF FIXING ISSUES AND MAKING IT WORK LIKE IT ONCE DID. PARANOIA IS OWNED BY MONGOOSE PUBLISHING
